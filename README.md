Buildable boss stones and more
## Known issues:

# Buildable Boss Stones
Ready for usage other than the placement effect overlay weirdness.

```
- Eikthyr Stone
- The Elder
- Bonemass
- Dragon Queen
- Yagluth
- Seeker Queen
```
# Custom Power Stones
Current version has a proof of concept with future plans to make them user configurable. For now, I am working through the possible combinations to develop a method for users to plug in string name of effects and create new guardian powers.
## Buildable Prefab - Forsaken Stone
```
Using the start temple stone plate I plugged in various effects from the game to create a new guardian power.

It provides the player with the fuling shaman magic shield using the same system as the guardian powers
```
Craftable Prefab - ForsakenSword_RS
```
added prefab one handed sword to use on the forsaken stone to unlock the guardian power
```
